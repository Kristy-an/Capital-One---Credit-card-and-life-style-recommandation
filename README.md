# How to Set up This App
1) This requires npm & node.js installed (i think)
2) In your terminal, go to backend directory
3) run "npm i" to install all the packages
4) Now go to the client directory
5) run "npm i" again to install all the packages in the client
6) neat! everything should be installed now

# How to Run This App
1) Open up a terminal
2) Go to the backend directory
3) In this directory, run "npm start" to run the backend server. It should display "Server listening on 3001" when it is finished
4) In another separate terminal, go to the client directory
5) Run "npm start" to run the frontend
6) Soon, the web page should automatically open up in your browser
7) If the web page says that the backend is offline, then either the backend server hasn't been ran or something is wrong, else you're good to go!
